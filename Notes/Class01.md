    # Machine Learning Overview

    Machine learning (ML) involves five key approaches:

- **"Pile of Data" Approaches:**
  - Analysis: Identifying data patterns.
  - Clustering: Finding similar data rows.


- **"Prediction" Approaches:**
  - Regression: Predicting real numbers.
  - Classification: Predicting categories.


- **"Change" Approach:**
  - Reinforcement Learning: Deciding actions for success (e.g., AI in games, robot training).
